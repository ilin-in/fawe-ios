h2. iOS Font Awesome Library

FAWE is a library (or XCode project actually) that provides new UI controls and extensions to 
native UI controls that both leverage the excellent Font Awesome icon font.

Instead of creating an image for each icon in your application, you can now start using 
Font Awesome icons, even with the default controls, such as UIButton.

Currently FAWE provides you
- extension to NSString (thanks to Alex Usbergo)
- extension to UIFont (thanks to Alex Usbergo)
- extension to UIButton
- FAWEIconView
